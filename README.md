# Dictionary_script

This script is meant to be used from a command line using the syntax python3 definitionScript.py

It will ask the user for the word they want the definition of

It will then attempt to find that word using freedictionaryapi.dev

If a word can't be found it will give an error

If the word can be found it will return the part of speech followed by a list of definitions

Added an option to request a word straight from the command line in this syntax: python3 definitionScript.py word
It will automatically search for the word given. You can still leave it blank and enter a word after entering the program though.

Updated to add part of speech input. User can enter from the command line in the same syntax but add a space and the part of speech after the word.
Or, the user can just run the program and enter the word then a space then the part of speech

I noticed there are some times when the freedictionary will return multiple definitions, many that I have never heard of. This is not my doing, its from the free dictionary I'm referencing.



Shout out to the free dictionary online for making possible this little project of mine.
